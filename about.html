            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>We are a company that provides e-Waste management and recycling services to individuals, businesses, and organizations. We offer solutions for e-Waste collection, transportation, sorting, recycling, and disposal. We also provide education and awareness programs on e-Waste and its environmental and social impacts.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to help you reduce your e-Waste footprint and contribute to a greener and cleaner planet. We are committed to following the best practices and standards for e-Waste management and recycling, and ensuring the safety and well-being of our workers and customers.</p>
            <p>Here are some of the activities that we do in e-Waste management and recycling:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We collect e-Waste from various sources, such as households, offices, schools, hospitals, etc. We use vehicles that are equipped with GPS and RFID systems to track and monitor the e-Waste movement. We also provide bins and bags for e-Waste segregation and storage.</li>
                <li>We transport e-Waste to our facilities, where we sort them into different categories, such as computers, laptops, mobile phones, TVs, printers, batteries, cables, etc. We use automated and manual methods to separate the e-Waste components, such as metals, plastics, glass, circuit boards, etc.</li>
                <li>We recycle e-Waste using various techniques, such as shredding, crushing, smelting, refining, etc. We recover valuable materials and resources from e-Waste, such as metals, plastics, and rare earth elements, which can be reused or recycled for new products. We also dispose of the non-recyclable or hazardous materials in a safe and secure manner, following the environmental regulations and guidelines.</li>
                <li>We educate and raise awareness on e-Waste and its environmental and social impacts. We conduct workshops, seminars, campaigns, and exhibitions to inform and inspire people about the benefits of e-Waste management and recycling. We also collaborate with various stakeholders, such as government agencies, NGOs, academic institutions, media, etc. to promote and support e-Waste management and recycling initiatives.</li>
            </ul>
